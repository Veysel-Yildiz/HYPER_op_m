This repository contains the HYPER_OP Toolbox is a state-of-the-art toolbox for the optimal design of a Run-of-River (RoR) hydropower plant. This toolbox provides advanced capabilities for optimizing the design and operation of RoR plants, enabling users to achieve optimal performance and efficiency.
The first methodology presented in the paper by  V. Yildizang J. Vrugt "A toolbox for the optimal design of run-of-river hydropower plants" published in EMS


In this latest version of the HYPER_OP Toolbox, we have introduced several exciting novelties and enhancements:

Operation Optimization with Design Flexibility
The toolbox now incorporates operation optimization capabilities, allowing for the design optimization process to determine the optimal choices of turbine number and type. This feature enables a more comprehensive and integrated approach to achieving optimal plant performance. Users can explore different turbine configurations and select the most suitable options based on their specific requirements.

Expanded Simulation Capabilities
We have enhanced the existing simulation module to accommodate more complex turbine configurations, specifically three and more turbine setups. This expansion enables accurate and detailed analysis of operation scenarios in these configurations, providing valuable insights for plant performance optimization. Users can now explore a wider range of turbine setups and evaluate their impact on plant performance.

Flexibility in Turbine Capacities
The software now offers the flexibility of selecting identical or different turbine capacities. This feature provides design flexibility, allowing users to match specific operational requirements. By customizing the turbine capacities, users can optimize the hydropower plant configuration to ensure optimal performance across a range of operating conditions. This flexibility enhances the adaptability and efficiency of the plant design.

Operation Simulation and Design Check Module
To facilitate comprehensive analysis and evaluation of system performance, we have integrated a dedicated module for simulating plant operations and performing design checks. This module enables users to simulate different operational scenarios, evaluate the plant's performance under varying conditions, identify potential issues, and ensure compliance with design requirements. It provides a valuable tool for validating and refining the design, ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
